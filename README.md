# PyCitySchools - Pandas Challenge
Help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 

District-wide standardized test results need to be analyzed with given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information in [CSV files](PyCitySchools/Resources/) on the schools they attend.

Task is to aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Programming Language / Applications - Used for Analysis

  * Python - Pandas Library
  * Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis

Analysis includes each of the following in a [Jupyter Notebook](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) with viewable Data Frames:

### District Summary

* High level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top & Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools and another table that highlights bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student)using 4 reasonable bins to group school spending, including in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* A table that breaks down school performances based on School Size using reasonable bins to group schools by size (Small, Medium, Large), including in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)


### Scores by School Type

* A table that breaks down school performances based on School Type (Charter vs. District), including in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

## Final Report

[Final report](PyCitySchools/FinalReport.docx) includes a written description of observable trends based on the data.
